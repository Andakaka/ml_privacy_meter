This directory consists of some sample attack code with their dependencies.
Following are the descriptions of the files.
- attack_alexnet.py : Sample Whitebox attack on Alexnet model trained on CIFAR-100 dataset (Described in README of project)
- attack_fcn.py : Sample Whitebox attack on Fully connected model on Purchase 100 dataset.
- alexnet.py : Sample code to train target Alexnet model which can be given as input for attack
- models/alexnet_pretrained.zip	: Pretrained Keras model for Alexnet trained on CIFAR-100 dataset, converted from pretrained [Pytorch model](https://github.com/bearpaw/pytorch-classification#pretrained-models) (Described in README of project)

Procedure to run can be found in project README.
