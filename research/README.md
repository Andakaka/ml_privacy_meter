# Research papers

We provide ways to reproduce the existing attacks' results in published papers in the [benchmark folder](../benchmark/README.md). Additionally, this file contains pointers to the code for generating all figures in the papers published by our group.

## Implementations

| Paper Title | Code Implementation |
| --- | --- |
