# Privacy Meter

## Installation

Privacy Meter supports Python `>=3.6` and works with `tensorflow>=2.4.0` and `torch>=1.10.0`. 

You can clone this repository and install the local version of tool with its dependencies by running the following:

```bash
pip install -r requirements.txt
pip install -e .
```

We will be publishing the tool to `PyPi` shortly so you can install the tool directly using `pip`.

## Usage

Examples of using the tool can be found in the `docs/` directory. The tutorials are provided as Jupyter notebooks.
